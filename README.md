Hi all,

Announcing a very simple new Plugin - 
**LED Simple Effects**

https://github.com/Ghawken/Indigo-SimpleLED

Enables the Fibaro RGBW pre-programmed color cycles to be selected as an Action Group.
[size=85](yes, yes - you can do this already with Z-wave modify config action command - once you know the parameters and the settings -  however this simplifies the process)[/size]
[size=85](I did mention it was a simple plugin - didn't I?)[/size]

The Plugin - essentially doesn't run unless a action command/group is executed.

The image below are the current options - essentially for the Fibaro RGB only currently (awaiting some fixes to enable the Aeon Labs RGB bulbs in addition.)

These are the pre-programmed Fibaro modes - so there is no Z-wave communication during the light changes - simply this command to start and/or end the process.   In my mind the various default modes cover most basic usages and limits any Z-wave traffic issues that might occur with other solutions.
